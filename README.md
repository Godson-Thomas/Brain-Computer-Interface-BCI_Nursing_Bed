_We are presenting an automated nursing bed in which the positions of the bed, alerts regarding health status of patient ,monitoring etc.. can be controlled by the patient's brain signals.<br>The heart of the system consists of Raspberry Pi module which receives the variations in the eye blink pattern of the patient through bluetooth module transmitted by the Brainwave sensor. The eye blink signal which is received in the time domain is converted to the frequency domain by Fast Fourier Transform using the algorithm developed by us in python.Accordingly position of the bed is adjusted and necessary alerts , messages regarding the bedridden patient's health status are sent to family members/Staffs via IOT. Alerting mechanism is also provided in order for keeping a perfect time schedule of the patientâ€™s medicine .<br>Analysis in both time and frequency is done to analyze the characteristics of the eye link so as to get an an accurate information regarding the need of the patient is deciphered._
